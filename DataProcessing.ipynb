    "1) *Cutting sample collection short.* **Discussion:** See power analysis below. Peer review pending.\n",
    "2) *Confirming random assignment.* **Discussion:** Randomizing at cluster level (company + job title).\n",
    "3) *Random assignment fails to equally distribute \"heavy\" segments across A/B.* **Discussion:** Equally distribute the following segments and assess post-assignment:\n",
    "   - Recency of job posting\n",
    "   - \"Repeat\" companies (see \"8)\" below)\n",
    "4) *Ensure the Ceteris Parabus assumption* (that is, ensure all else is same between treatment/control besides the treatment). **Discussion:** Use the exact resume and cover letter provided for both.\n",
    "5) *Cross-contamination for treatment and control groups.* **Discussion:** I don't think we'll have to worry about this, unless a recruiter leaves one company and goes to another.\n",
    "6) *Multiple comparisons can lead to higher false positive rate.* **Discussion:** Only making one comparison -- professionally written resume vs. self-written resume.\n",
    "7) *Simpson's paradox due to graduated roll-outs.* **Discussion:** I'm only performing one testing period, so this point is moot. Could simply look at final period if so.\n",
    "8) *Primacy or novelty effect.* **Discussion:** This could be a problem, if I previously applied for a role with a company before conducting the experiment. I can adjust for this by running the experiment longer, but that's not really helpful given my current situation. Instead, I will include a category segment across treatment/control for repeat and new companies.\n",
    "    - \"Repeat\" = companies that I've applied to before. I'll attempt to equally distribute these during assignment.\n",
    "    - \"New\" = companies that I have not applied to before. I'll attempt to equally distribute these during assignment."
