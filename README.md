# Resume Experiment
In 2024 I decided to apply to open data science and analytics positions. Often, the rejection/interview decision for these positions seemed like a black box. I was never sure why particular companies rejected or accepted my application. 

I wondered how/why recruiters were reaching their conclusions. Professionals had often suggested getting a professionally written resume and cover letter in order to be seen by ATS and recruiting processes. I decided to run experiment--show my self-written resume and cover letters to some applications while using a resume and cover letter written by a certified resume writer. Here's what I discovered!
